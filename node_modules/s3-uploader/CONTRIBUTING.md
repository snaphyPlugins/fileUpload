## Before submitting a bug or feature request

* **Have you actually read the error message**?

* Have you searched for [similar
  issues](https://github.com/Turistforeningen/node-s3-uploader/issues)?

* Have you updated to the latest stable version of node, s3-uploader, and other
  packages you are using?

* Have you checked that it's not a problem with one of the packages you're
  using, rather than s3-uploader itself?

* Have you looked at what's involved in fixing/implementing this yourself?

Capable programmers should always attempt to investigate and fix problems
themselves before asking for others to help. Submit a pull request instead of an
issue!

## A great bug report contains

* Context – what were you trying to achieve?

* Detailed steps to reproduce the error from scratch. Try isolating the minimal
  amount of code needed to reproduce the error.

* Evidence you've looked into solving the problem and ideally, a theory on the
  cause and a possible solution.

## A great feature request contains

* The current situation.

* How and why the current situation is problematic.

* A detailed proposal or pull request that demonstrates how the problem could be
  solved.

* A use case – who needs this feature and why?

* Any caveats.

## A great pull request contains

* Minimal changes. Only submit code relevant to the current issue. Other changes
  should go in new pull requests.

* Minimal commits. Please squash to a single commit before sending your pull
  request.

* No conflicts. Please rebase off the latest master before submitting.

* Code conforming to the existing conventions and formats. i.e. Please don't
  reformat whitespace.

* Passing tests in `test` directory. Use [existing
  tests](https://github.com/s3-uploader/s3-uploader/tree/master/test) as a
  reference.

* [Documentation](https://github.com/s3-uploader/s3-uploader/tree/master/README.md).
